Subject: Data Quality Review and Next Steps for Optimizing Receipts, Users, and Brands Data

Hi 

I’ve reviewed the data across Receipts, Users, and Brands and identified several quality issues. Here’s an update on my findings and next steps.

Data Quality Issues:

Missing Values: Critical fields (e.g., userId, brandId) have null values.
Duplicates: Duplicate records were found, particularly with _id values.

Needed Actions:

Missing Data: Clarify whether missing values should be filled or removed.
Duplicates: Determine if deduplication needs to be enforced during data load.

Optimization Needs:

Business Rules: Clarify how to handle missing data to maintain accuracy in reporting.
Data Load Pipeline: Understand the loading and processing steps to pinpoint quality issues.
Expected Data Growth: Know the scaling expectations to optimize storage and query performance.

Performance and Scaling Concerns:

Query Performance: Large data joins may slow down queries, requiring indexing and optimization.
Data Consistency: Enforcing foreign key relationships will be crucial for consistency.

Next Steps:

Review the data loading process for missing or invalid references.
Establish rules for handling missing values.
Implement validation to ensure data consistency and flag outliers.

Let me know if you’d like to discuss further or have additional insights. I look forward to improving the data quality to meet business needs.



Thanks
